# Hospital-backend
Backend school project done using Spring Boot Web (MVC), thymeleaf templates, JPA (H2-database) etc.
This project represents a fictional hospital patients database system with an awfully retro GUI. 

This project can be found live at: [Hospital-Backend Project deployed at Heroku](https://backend-hospital-project.herokuapp.com/login)

Keep in mind that when the site has been idle for 30 minutes, it may take a while (1-2 min) to launch. After that it works smoothly
without delay. So if you happen to inspect the site, it could take a while for the site to load. 

### Credentials: 
> User Name: admin

> Password: password1 

Possible to change existing data in H2 (virtual memory based) database (modify, add and remove data).
